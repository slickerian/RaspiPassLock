A raspberry pi based password manager, that can be used as a personal password manager for your home, completely disconnected from the outside world. The Pi puts out a hotspot that the user can connect and hosts a website for the user to give their password and login.
New users can be added and each user has a seperate account where they can store and retrieve their usernames and passwords. The raspberry pi is connected to a SD card for now and can be upgraded to an ssd for bigger and faster storage.
Done as a cybersecurity project for 3rd year.
Components used: 
1. Raspberry Pi Pico W
2. SD card reader
